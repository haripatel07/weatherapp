# weatherapp
This weatherapp was a practice work made with the help of a tutorial
The idea was for the user to enter the name of the city, and a card displaying the weather info would be displayed.
The weather info was attained from a weather api provided by the openweathermap.org
The program is simple and uses minimal functions but it is an effective way of practising the concepts of JS.
